# Machine Learning & Agriculture

This project was my submission for the fullfillment of my engineering degree. It is an attemt to demonstrate how machine learning can be implemented into agriculture to maximize yield.

##### Programming language - Java
##### Major Machine Learning algorithms and tools used are:
* SVM - Support Vector Machines
* WEKA - A machine learning library.
* Naive Bayes Classifier

It is a very basic Java Swing project. Front-end was not the focus of the project and hence, Swing was used. Any major suggestions to improve it are welcome. The aim of this project was to demonstrate the machine learning uses in the field of agriculture.
